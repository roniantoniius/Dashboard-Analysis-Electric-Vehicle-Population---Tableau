# Dashboard Analysys Electric Vehicle Population
In this project, I analyzed electric vehicle population data to gain insight into the distribution and preferences of electric vehicle owners in Washington. I chose the region because compared to other regions in the US, the city of washington has the most complete data. This dataset includes features such as VIN, County, City, State, Postal Code, Model Year, Make, Model, Electric Vehicle Type, CAFV Eligibility, Electric Range, Base MSRP, Legislative District, DOL Vehicle ID, Vehicle Location, and Electric Utility.

### Business Understanding
The business understanding phase focuses on identifying trends and patterns that could be useful to stakeholders involved in policy or business making in the electric vehicle industry. I was particularly interested in understanding the distribution of different types of electric vehicles across different counties and cities and identifying popular makes and models.

### Data Understanding
During the data understanding phase, I explored the characteristics of each feature including their type (categorical or numerical), the range or set of categories they cover. I also identified missing values or inconsistencies that needed to be addressed during data preparation.

### Data Preparation
In the data preparation phase, I cleaned up the dataset by handling missing values appropriately - either by filling them in or deleting records with missing values depending on their volume and importance. I also changed some features to make them more suitable for analysis - for example categorizing the model years into ranges to observe trends over time.

### Visualization
The visualizations created using Tableau provide a comprehensive overview. It includes a doughnut chart showing the proportion of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) versus plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), a map showing vehicle ownership by zip code area with varying intensities representing volume; a bar graph showing the top 10 counties with the highest EV ownership; another bar graph displaying car brands along with their numbers; and finally a histogram displaying the distribution across various model years.

This visualization helps in identifying areas with higher EV adoption rates which can be crucial for planning infrastructure development such as charging stations. It also highlights popular brands which can be valuable information for new players entering into the market or existing players looking to increase market share.
